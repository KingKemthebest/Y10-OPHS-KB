#cvariables are declared in titlecase
#Cosnstant are declared in CAPITALS

#Example of variable

Team1Name = "king kem"
Teams2name = "Atlas"

#variable have a useful name
#variable store a value (can change)
#variables can NOT start with a number
#e.g. 1TeamName = "Atlas"
#This will be a syntax error

#this is an example of a constant
